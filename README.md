## üìå Overview
This project aims to improve healthcare outcomes by leveraging **predictive analytics** to provide **data-driven insights** for healthcare professionals. We developed **three machine learning models** to predict patient risk for:

- Hypertension  
- Stroke  
- Diabetes  

The models help in identifying high-risk patients, discovering trends in health metrics, and supporting more informed medical decisions.

---

## üìÇ Datasets Used
We utilized three publicly available healthcare datasets:

1. **Hypertension Dataset**
2. **Stroke Prediction Dataset**
3. **Diabetes Dataset**

Each dataset includes patient health metrics such as age, gender, medical history, test results, and outcomes.
